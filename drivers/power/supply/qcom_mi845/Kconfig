          Say Y to enables support for the SMB2 charging peripheral.
          The QPNP SMB2 charger driver supports the charger peripheral
          present in the PMICOBALT chip.
          The power supply framework is used to communicate battery and
          usb properties to userspace and other driver consumers such
          as fuel gauge, USB, and USB-PD.
          VBUS and VCONN regulators are registered for supporting OTG,
          and powered Type-C cables respectively.

	  Say Y to include support for SMB1355 Battery Charger.
	  SMB1355 is a single phase 5A battery charger.
	  The driver supports charger enable/disable.
	  The driver reports the charger status via the power supply framework.
	  A charger status change triggers an IRQ via the device STAT pin.

        help
          Say Y here to enable the GEN3 Fuel Gauge driver. This adds support
          for battery fuel gauging and state of charge of battery connected to
          the fuel gauge. The state of charge is reported through a BMS power
          supply property and also sends uevents when the capacity is updated.
